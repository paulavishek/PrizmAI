## 📊 Kanban Boards (The Basics)

### What Is a Kanban Board?

A visual system to manage work:
- **Columns** = Work stages (To Do → In Progress → Done)
- **Cards** = Individual tasks
- **Movement** = Progress through the workflow

**Think of it like:** Sticky notes on a whiteboard that you move left to right as work progresses.

### Creating a Board

1. Click "New Board"
2. Name it something clear: "Website Redesign 2025" or "Q1 Bug Fixes"
3. Choose to use AI suggestions OR create columns manually
4. Start adding tasks

**Pro tip:** The more specific your board name, the better AI can help you.

### Board Columns

**Common columns (AI suggests these automatically):**
- **Planning** - Thinking and planning phase
- **To Do** - Ready to start
- **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- **In Review** - Waiting for approval/feedback
- **Done** - Completed and shipped

You can rename these or add your own. There's no limit.

### Tasks (The Cards)

Each task represents one piece of work.

**What you can put on a task:**
- ✅ Title: "Design login page"
- ✅ Description: What needs to be done
- ✅ Due date: When it should be finished
- ✅ Assigned to: Who's responsible
- ✅ Priority: High, Medium, Low
- ✅ Labels/Tags: For organization
- ✅ Attachments: Links or files
- ✅ Comments: Team discussion

### Drag & Drop

Click and hold a task card, drag it to a new column. That's progress!

Example: Task moves from "To Do" → "In Progress" → "Done"

**What happens:**
- Status updates automatically
- Team gets notified
- Progress percentage may update
- Activity log records the change

### Task Progress

Each task has a progress bar (0-100%):
- 0% = Not started
- 50% = Half done
- 100% = Complete

You can set it manually or let AI track it.

### Filtering & Search

Find tasks quickly:
- By team member assigned
- By priority
- By due date
- By labels/tags
- By search text

**Example:** "Show me all HIGH priority tasks assigned to me, due this week"
