## 🔍 **Explainable AI**

### What is Explainable AI?

PrizmAI doesn't just make recommendations - it **explains them**. Every AI decision includes:
- Why the AI reached that conclusion
- How confident it is
- What factors influenced the decision
- What assumptions it made
- Known limitations
- Alternative perspectives

**This is revolutionary because:**
- Traditional AI tools just say "Here's my recommendation" (trust us!)
- PrizmAI says "Here's my recommendation, here's why, and here's what I'm uncertain about"

### How Explainability Works in Practice

Whenever you see an AI recommendation, look for the **"Why?"** button. Click it to get:

#### **1. Risk Assessment Explanation**

```
Task: "Integrate Payment Gateway"
Risk Score: 7/10

Why?
├─ AI Confidence: 82% (Pretty sure about this)
├─ Contributing Factors:
│  ├─ 35% - Task Complexity (multiple integration points)
│  ├─ 30% - External Dependencies (payment processor approval)
│  ├─ 20% - Skill Gap (needs expert, only have intermediate)
│  └─ 15% - Timeline Pressure (3 days vs typical 5 days)
├─ Calculation: Likelihood (2) × Impact (3) = Risk (6)
├─ Model Assumptions:
│  └─ Bob can dedicate 6 hours/day to this task
├─ Data Limitations:
│  └─ Limited historical payment integration data
└─ Alternative View:
   └─ Risk could be lower if using Stripe SDK instead
```

**What This Means for You:**
- You understand exactly why it's risky
- You can challenge the assumption if Bob has more time
- You can mitigate the risk by choosing Stripe
- You know the AI is 82% confident (not a guess)

#### **2. Deadline Prediction Explanation**

```
Task: "Implement User Dashboard"
Predicted Completion: Mar 25, 2026
Confidence: 78%

Click "Why?" to see:
├─ AI Confidence: 78% (fairly reliable)
├─ Similar Historical Tasks:
│  ├─ "Build Admin Panel" - 4.2 days (similar complexity)
│  ├─ "Implement Settings Page" - 3.8 days
│  ├─ "Create Dashboard Layout" - 5.1 days
│  └─ ... (4 more similar tasks)
├─ Calculation:
│  ├─ Base Estimate: 3 days
│  ├─ × Complexity Factor: 1.4 (medium complexity)
│  ├─ × Current Workload: 1.2 (team busy this week)
│  └─ + Buffer: 1 day (for unknowns)
│  = Final: 5.4 → 6 days
├─ Assumptions:
│  ├─ Bob dedicated 6-8 hours/day
│  ├─ No major API delays
│  └─ Code review takes 1 day
├─ Alternative Scenarios:
│  ├─ Optimistic: Nov 23 (if no blockers)
│  ├─ Realistic: Nov 25 (most likely)
│  └─ Pessimistic: Nov 28 (if API delays happen)
└─ Risk Factors:
   ├─ External API dependency
   └─ Team has 3 other urgent tasks
```

**What This Means for You:**
- You can promise clients a realistic date (Nov 25)
- You know the worst case (Nov 28) to budget for delays
- You understand why (complexity, team capacity)
- You can change the outcome (remove other urgent tasks, hire help, use pre-built APIs)

#### **3. Assignee Recommendation Explanation**

```

## 🎓 **AI Coach for Project Managers**

**Get proactive coaching and intelligent guidance to improve your project management decisions in real-time.**

The AI Coach is like having an experienced mentor looking over your shoulder, watching your project metrics and offering timely, actionable advice. It automatically detects problems before they become critical and learns from your feedback to improve suggestions over time.

### What It Does

The AI Coach continuously monitors your project and:

- 🚨 **Catches problems early** - Detects velocity drops, resource overloads, and risks before they escalate
- ⚠️ **Prevents disasters** - Alerts you when multiple high-risk tasks converge
- 💡 **Spots opportunities** - Identifies skilled team members ready for challenging work
- 📈 **Learns and improves** - Gets smarter from your feedback and actions
- 🎯 **Provides actionable guidance** - Suggests concrete steps to improve your project

### Core Features

**1. Intelligent Pattern Detection**

The rule engine analyzes your project in real-time and detects:

```
Detected Issues:
├─ 🔴 Velocity Drop: Team completing 30% fewer tasks this week
├─ 🟠 Resource Overload: Jane has 10 active tasks (2x normal)
├─ 🔴 Risk Convergence: 3 high-risk tasks due same week
├─ 🟡 Scope Creep: 15% increase in total tasks and complexity
├─ 🟠 Deadline Risk: 40% probability of missing deadline
├─ 🟡 Team Burnout: 4 team members working overtime for 2+ weeks
├─ 🟡 Quality Issues: 5 tasks reopened this week (double normal)
├─ 🔴 Communication Gap: 2 blockers waiting on external response
├─ 🟠 Skill Opportunity: Bob ready to lead complex database work
└─ 🔵 Best Practice: Consider parallel testing for faster feedback
```

**2. AI-Enhanced Reasoning**

Each suggestion includes AI-generated explanations:

```
Suggestion: "Your Velocity is Dropping"
────────────────────────────────────

Why This Matters:
  Your team completed 30% fewer tasks this week (12 vs 18 tasks).
  This pattern typically precedes project delays.

What Might Be Happening:
  ├─ Blocking issues delaying task completion
  ├─ Increased complexity of recent tasks
  ├─ Team members pulled to other work
  └─ Skill gap in emerging technology

Recommended Actions:
  1. Run quick team standup to identify blockers
  2. Review 3 oldest "In Progress" tasks for issues
  3. Pair junior developers with senior mentors
  4. Consider simplifying next task scope

Expected Impact:
  If you address blockers, velocity should recover within 2-3 days.

AI Confidence: 82% (based on 12 similar patterns in past projects)
```

**3. Continuous Learning**

The system learns from your feedback and improves:

```
Learning Cycle:
  1. System generates suggestion
  2. You take action (or dismiss suggestion)
  3. System learns what worked
  4. Next similar situation → better suggestion

Example Learning:
  Week 1: Coach suggests "Pair programming will improve quality"
          You dismiss it, code reviews work better for your team
  Week 2: Coach suggests "Pair programming"
          But with lower confidence (remembers you prefer code reviews)
  Week 3: Coach suggests "Code review needed" instead
          Confidence: 95% (learned your preference)
```

### Types of Suggestions You'll Receive

## 🚨 **Automated Conflict Detection & Resolution**

**Automatically detect and resolve resource, schedule, and dependency conflicts before they derail your projects.**

### What It Detects

**Resource Conflicts**
- Same person assigned to multiple tasks at the same time
- Team members overbooked beyond capacity
- Critical skills bottlenecks (one person is the only expert)
- Conflicting assignment requests
- Workload imbalances across team

**Schedule Conflicts**
- Task deadlines that overlap with dependencies
- Impossible timelines (due date before task can realistically start)
- Critical path delays due to resource unavailability
- Sprint commitments exceeding team capacity
- Meeting overload preventing task work

**Dependency Conflicts**
- Circular dependencies (Task A depends on B, B depends on A)
- Broken dependency chains (Task depends on cancelled task)
- Missing dependencies (task assumes prior work that isn't tracked)
- Critical path bottlenecks (one task blocks multiple others)
- External dependency risks

### How It Works

**Automatic Detection:**
1. PrizmAI continuously scans your board for conflicts
2. AI analyzes: assignments, due dates, dependencies, team capacity
3. Conflicts are scored by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
4. Dashboard shows all active conflicts with impact analysis
5. Real-time alerts notify team members of new conflicts

**AI-Powered Suggestions:**

For each detected conflict, AI generates multiple resolution options with reasoning and confidence scores.

### Example: Resource Conflict

```
Conflict: Jane assigned to 3 simultaneous tasks
Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL
Impact: Will miss all deadlines, team blocked

🤖 AI Suggestions:
1. Reassign "Mobile UI" to Tom
   ├─ Confidence: 88%
   ├─ Reasoning: Tom completed similar work 15% faster
   ├─ Impact: Jane has capacity, Tom handles 40% of work
   └─ Risk: Tom not familiar with design system

2. Extend "API Integration" deadline by 3 days
   ├─ Confidence: 92%
   ├─ Reasoning: Current deadline gives only 2 days/task
   ├─ Impact: Realistic timeline, all work completes on schedule
   └─ Risk: Client communication needed

3. Split "Authentication" into 2 subtasks
   ├─ Confidence: 78%
   ├─ Reasoning: Can parallelize OAuth & JWT implementation
   ├─ Impact: Jane + Bob work together, faster completion
   └─ Risk: Requires coordination overhead
```

### Features

✅ **Automatic Detection** - Continuously scans for conflicts  
✅ **AI Suggestions** - Multiple resolution options with reasoning  
✅ **Confidence Scoring** - Understand reliability of each suggestion  
✅ **Smart Learning** - System learns which resolutions work for your team  
✅ **Real-time Alerts** - Proactive notifications of emerging conflicts

## 🌍 **Per-User Timezone Support**

PrizmAI supports users across the globe with per-user timezone preferences, ensuring every date, time, and deadline is displayed in the user's local timezone.

### How It Works

1. **Topbar Timezone Selector** — A globe icon in the top navigation bar lets users switch their timezone instantly from a searchable dropdown grouped by region (Americas, Europe, Asia & Pacific, Middle East & Africa).
2. **Browser Auto-Detection** — On first visit, PrizmAI detects the browser's timezone and suggests switching if it differs from the current setting.
3. **Profile Settings** — Timezone can also be changed from the user's Profile page.

### What Gets Converted

- **All server-rendered dates and times** — Task due dates, activity timestamps, audit logs, notifications, and more automatically display in the user's timezone via Django's `timezone.activate()` middleware.
- **Calendar views** — FullCalendar (board calendar and unified calendar) renders events in the selected timezone.
- **AI Assistant (Spectra)** — When you ask Spectra "what time is it?" or it references dates, it uses your timezone.
- **Deadline predictions** — AI-predicted completion dates display in the user's local timezone.
- **Gantt chart** — Date-based fields render correctly; DateTimeField due dates are converted by the middleware.

### Technical Details

- Datetimes are stored in **UTC** in the database (`USE_TZ = True`).
- A `TimezoneMiddleware` activates the user's timezone for each HTTP request.
- Timezone preference is cached in the session to avoid database lookups on every request.
- Default timezone for existing users: **Asia/Kolkata (IST)** — backward-compatible with no disruption.
- Supports all 400+ IANA timezones via `pytz.common_timezones`.
   - Success metrics

3. **CONTRACTOR + TRAINING** (Balanced Approach)
   - Expert mentoring model
   - Knowledge transfer strategy
   - Budget and timeline

4. **REDISTRIBUTE** (Use Existing Skills)
   - Team reconfiguration options
   - Quality and timeline implications

### Features

✅ **Automatic Detection** - No manual data entry required  
✅ **Continuous Monitoring** - Gaps update as team skills change  
✅ **AI Recommendations** - Concrete solutions (hire, train, redistribute)  
✅ **Development Plans** - Track progress on closing gaps  
✅ **Affected Tasks View** - See impact of each gap  
✅ **Team Skill Matrix** - Visual view of all team capabilities  
✅ **Historical Trends** - Track skill development over time

## 🎯 **AI-Powered Resource Leveling & Optimization**

**Let AI automatically recommend the best task assignments to balance team workload and maximize productivity.**

### How AI Resource Optimization Works

PrizmAI analyzes five key factors to recommend the best person for each task:

```
Assignment Score Calculation:

Skill Match (30%)
├─ How well does the person's skills match the task requirements?
├─ Based on: Task keywords vs. person's work history
└─ Example: Task mentions "React" → Jane has completed 15 React tasks

Availability (25%)
├─ How much free capacity does this person have?
