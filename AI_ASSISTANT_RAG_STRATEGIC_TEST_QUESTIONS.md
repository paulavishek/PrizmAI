# AI Assistant RAG & Strategic Thinking Test Questions

## 🎯 Purpose

These questions test the AI Assistant's ability to:
1. **Combine web search (RAG)** with project-specific data
2. **Apply best practices** from industry to your specific situation
3. **Provide strategic recommendations** based on both external knowledge and internal data
4. **Think critically** about project management challenges

## 🔍 How RAG Works in These Questions

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** means:
1. AI detects a strategic/how-to question
2. Performs web search for current best practices
3. Retrieves your project data from database
4. **Combines both** to give contextualized advice

## ✅ Expected RAG Behavior

For each strategic question, the AI should:

1. **🔍 Detect strategic intent** - Recognize this needs external knowledge
2. **🌐 Trigger web search** - Search for relevant best practices/trends
3. **📊 Retrieve project data** - Get relevant data from your database
4. **🤝 Combine intelligently** - Merge web knowledge with your specific context
5. **💡 Provide actionable advice** - Give specific, implementable recommendations

## 📊 Response Quality Indicators

### ✅ Good RAG Response Should Include:

1. **External Knowledge**
   - "According to agile best practices..."
   - "Industry research shows..."
   - "Common strategies include..."
   - Source citations when available

2. **Your Specific Data**
   - "Based on your Software Project board..."
   - "Looking at your team of 6 members..."
   - "Your 3 overdue tasks are..."
   - Actual numbers and names

3. **Combined Recommendations**
   - "Given your situation, I recommend..."
   - "Applying [best practice] to your [specific task]..."
   - "Here's a tailored plan for your project..."

4. **Actionable Steps**
   - Numbered action items
   - Specific assignments
   - Clear priorities
   - Expected outcomes

### ❌ Poor RAG Response Would Be:

- Generic advice without project context
- Project data without strategic guidance
- No web search when clearly needed
- Conflicting advice from web vs data

## 🧪 Testing Methodology

### Step 1: Test Pure RAG (Questions 41-50)
- Verify web search is triggered
- Check if current (2025) information is retrieved
- Ensure responses cite sources

### Step 2: Test Basic RAG + Data (Questions 1-10)
- Verify both web search AND project data retrieval
- Check if they're combined intelligently
- Ensure recommendations are specific

### Step 3: Test Complex RAG (Questions 36-40, 51-55)
- Verify multi-data analysis
- Check strategic depth
- Ensure comprehensive action plans

### Step 4: Test Edge Cases
- Ask strategic questions with no project data
- Ask with minimal data
- Ask contradictory scenarios

## 🎯 Success Criteria

A successful RAG response must:

1. ✅ **Trigger web search** when appropriate (check logs)
2. ✅ **Include external knowledge** from search results
3. ✅ **Include your project data** when relevant
4. ✅ **Combine both** in a coherent recommendation
5. ✅ **Be actionable** with specific next steps
6. ✅ **Be contextual** - advice fits YOUR situation
7. ✅ **Cite sources** when providing external information
8. ✅ **Show strategic thinking** - not just data regurgitation

## 💡 Pro Tips for Testing

### To Verify RAG is Working:

1. **Check response for phrases like:**
   - "According to industry best practices..."
   - "Recent research suggests..."
   - "Common approaches include..."
   - "Based on your [specific data]..."

2. **Look for combination of:**
   - External frameworks/methodologies
   - Your actual task names and numbers
   - Specific action steps tailored to you

3. **Verify web search was triggered:**
   - Check application logs
   - Look for "used_web_search: true" in response
   - See if search sources are listed

### Questions to Ask Yourself:

- ❓ Could this answer come from generic PM knowledge alone?
- ❓ Does it reference current (2025) practices?
- ❓ Does it use my actual project data?
- ❓ Are recommendations specific to MY situation?
- ❓ Can I implement this advice immediately?
