## 🤖 Gemini-Powered Features

PrizmAI leverages Google's advanced Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite model to make project management smarter, faster, and more efficient:

### 🧠 How Our Gemini AI Works

Our intelligent features are not based on simple rules or templates. **PrizmAI uses Google's Gemini, a powerful large language model, to provide genuine creativity and analysis.** When you request a recommendation or summary, your project's context (like a board title or comment thread) is securely sent to the Gemini API. The model then generates insightful, human-like responses that understand your specific business context.

**🔒 Privacy & Security:**
- Your sensitive project data is processed securely through Google's enterprise-grade APIs
- No data is stored permanently by the AI model - each request is independent
- All AI processing respects your organization's access permissions
- You maintain full control over when and how AI features are used

**🎯 Why Gemini?**
- **Advanced Understanding**: Recognizes context, industry patterns, and best practices
- **Human-like Intelligence**: Provides thoughtful recommendations, not just automated responses  
- **Continuous Learning**: Benefits from Google's ongoing AI improvements
- **Proven Reliability**: Enterprise-grade infrastructure you can trust

This API-driven approach allows PrizmAI to leverage cutting-edge AI without requiring you to manage any training data or complex infrastructure.
