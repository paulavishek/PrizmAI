## 🧠 The "Smart" Part - AI Features

### 🎯 **Explainable AI - Understand Why the AI Recommends What It Does**

One of PrizmAI's most powerful features is that **AI decisions are completely transparent**. You never have to wonder "Why did the AI say this?" Every recommendation comes with a detailed explanation.

**How It Works:**

Whenever AI makes a recommendation (risk score, deadline prediction, assignee suggestion), you can click **"Why?"** to see:

1. **AI Confidence Level** - How sure is the AI? (50% = uncertain, 95% = very confident)
2. **Contributing Factors** - What influenced the decision, ranked by importance
3. **Calculation Breakdown** - The math behind the recommendation
4. **Assumptions** - What the AI assumed to be true
5. **Data Limitations** - What the AI didn't have information about
6. **Alternative Interpretations** - Other possible perspectives

**Real Example:**

```
Task: "Integrate Payment Gateway"
Risk Score: 7/9

Why?
├─ AI Confidence: 82%
├─ Contributing Factors:
│  ├─ High Complexity (35%) - Financial systems need multiple security checks
│  ├─ External Dependency (30%) - Waiting on payment processor approval
│  ├─ Assignee Skill Gap (20%) - Bob has intermediate skills, needs expert
│  └─ Timeline Pressure (15%) - Due in 3 days, typical is 5 days
├─ Calculation: Likelihood (2) × Impact (3) = Risk Score (6)
├─ Model Assumptions:
│  └─ Bob can dedicate 6 hours/day to this task
├─ Data Limitations:
│  └─ Limited historical payment integration data
└─ Alternative View:
   └─ Risk could be lower if using Stripe instead of custom implementation
```

**Where You'll See "Why?" Buttons:**

- **Risk Assessment** - "Why is this high risk?"
- **Deadline Prediction** - "Why do you think this deadline?"
- **Assignee Recommendation** - "Why assign to this person?"
- **Priority Suggestion** - "Why is this high priority?"
- **Workload Forecast** - "Why will this person be overloaded?"

**Benefits:**

✅ **Build Trust** - You can verify AI reasoning makes sense  
✅ **Make Better Decisions** - Understand what factors matter  
✅ **Spot Errors Early** - Challenge the AI if reasoning is flawed  
✅ **Learn Patterns** - Understand your team's performance better  
✅ **Compliance Ready** - Full audit trail for enterprise requirements

**1. Configure Categories:**
- When creating or editing a wiki category, select the AI assistant type:
  - **Meeting Analysis** - For collaborative discussions and decisions
  - **Documentation Assistant** - For reference materials and guides
  - **None** - Disable AI features for this category

**2. Automatic Detection:**
- When viewing a wiki page, the correct AI assistant appears based on the page's category
- No manual switching needed - it's automatic and contextual
- Visual indicators show which AI type is available

**3. Clear Visual Guidance:**
- **Category badges** show AI type in category lists
- **Info banners** on wiki pages explain which AI is available
- **Sidebar cards** provide quick reference for AI capabilities
- **Icon indicators** differentiate meeting vs documentation analysis

#### **Why Category-Based Configuration?**

✅ **Predictable** - You know exactly which AI will be available  
✅ **Consistent** - All pages in a category use the same AI type  
✅ **User-Controlled** - You decide which AI fits your content  
✅ **No Surprises** - Clear visual indicators throughout the interface  
✅ **Organized** - Natural fit with your existing content structure  

#### **Getting Started with Wiki AI**

**For New Wiki Categories:**
1. Click "New Category"
2. Choose AI assistant type from dropdown:
   - Meeting Analysis (for notes and discussions)
   - Documentation Assistant (for guides and references)
   - None (no AI features)
3. Create your wiki pages in that category
4. AI button appears automatically based on category setting

**For Existing Categories:**
1. Navigate to wiki category list
2. Edit any category
3. Select appropriate AI assistant type
4. Save - all pages in that category now use the selected AI

**Visual Indicators:**
- 📊 **Blue badge** = Meeting Analysis AI available
- 📖 **Green badge** = Documentation Assistant AI available
- 🚫 **Gray badge** = No AI features for this category

#### **Best Practices**

**Use Meeting Analysis For:**
- Content with action items and decisions
- Collaborative discussions and brainstorming
- Planning sessions and retrospectives
- Client or stakeholder meetings
- Any content where tasks need to be extracted

**Use Documentation Assistant For:**
- Technical guides and references
- Process documentation and SOPs
- Knowledge base articles
- Training materials and tutorials
- Best practices and guidelines
- Any reference material that doesn't require task extraction

**Disable AI When:**
- Highly sensitive or confidential content
- Personal notes not meant for analysis
- Content that doesn't benefit from AI processing
- Simple lists or directories

---

**Result:** Your team gets AI assistance that's perfectly tailored to the type of content you're working with, making documentation more actionable and organized.

## 🎯 Explainable AI - Never Wonder "Why?" Again

### What is Explainable AI?

PrizmAI doesn't just make recommendations - it **explains them**. Every AI decision includes:
- Why the AI reached that conclusion
- How confident it is
- What factors influenced the decision
- What assumptions it made
- Known limitations
- Alternative perspectives

**This is revolutionary because:**
- Traditional AI tools just say "Here's my recommendation" (trust us!)
- PrizmAI says "Here's my recommendation, here's why, and here's what I'm uncertain about"

### How Explainability Works in Practice

Whenever you see an AI recommendation, look for the **"Why?"** button. Click it to get:

#### **1. Risk Assessment Explanation**

```
Task: "Integrate Payment Gateway"
Risk Score: 7/10

Click "Why?" to see:
├─ AI Confidence: 82% (Pretty sure about this)
├─ Contributing Factors:
│  ├─ 35% - Task Complexity (multiple integration points)
│  ├─ 30% - External Dependencies (payment processor approval)
│  ├─ 20% - Skill Gap (needs expert, only have intermediate)
│  └─ 15% - Timeline Pressure (3 days vs typical 5 days)
├─ Calculation: Likelihood (2) × Impact (3) = Risk (6)
├─ Model Assumptions:
│  └─ Bob can dedicate 6 hours/day to this task
├─ Data Limitations:
│  └─ Limited historical payment integration data
└─ Alternative View:
   └─ Risk could be lower if using Stripe SDK instead
```

**What This Means for You:**
- You understand exactly why it's risky
- You can challenge the assumption if Bob has more time
- You can mitigate the risk by choosing Stripe
- You know the AI is 82% confident (not a guess)

#### **2. Deadline Prediction Explanation**

```
Task: "Implement User Dashboard"
Predicted Completion: Nov 25, 2025
Confidence: 78%

Click "Why?" to see:
├─ AI Confidence: 78% (fairly reliable)
├─ Similar Historical Tasks:
│  ├─ "Build Admin Panel" - 4.2 days (similar complexity)
│  ├─ "Implement Settings Page" - 3.8 days
│  ├─ "Create Dashboard Layout" - 5.1 days
│  └─ ... (4 more similar tasks)
├─ Calculation:
│  ├─ Base Estimate: 3 days
│  ├─ × Complexity Factor: 1.4 (medium complexity)
│  ├─ × Current Workload: 1.2 (team busy this week)
│  └─ + Buffer: 1 day (for unknowns)
│  = Final: 5.4 → 6 days
├─ Assumptions:
│  ├─ Bob dedicated 6-8 hours/day
│  ├─ No major API delays
│  └─ Code review takes 1 day
├─ Alternative Scenarios:
│  ├─ Optimistic: Nov 23 (if no blockers)
│  ├─ Realistic: Nov 25 (most likely)
│  └─ Pessimistic: Nov 28 (if API delays happen)
└─ Risk Factors:
   ├─ External API dependency
   └─ Team has 3 other urgent tasks
```

**What This Means for You:**
- You can promise clients a realistic date (Nov 25)
- You know the worst case (Nov 28) to budget for delays
- You understand why (complexity, team capacity)
- You can change the outcome (remove other urgent tasks, hire help, use pre-built APIs)

#### **3. Assignee Recommendation Explanation**

```
Recommended: Jane Smith

Click "Why?" to see:
├─ Skill Match Score: 92%
├─ Skill Breakdown:
│  ├─ Python: Need Expert → Jane has Expert (100% match)
│  ├─ React: Need Advanced → Jane has Advanced (100% match)
│  ├─ AWS: Need Intermediate → Jane has Advanced (95% match)
│  └─ API Design: Need Intermediate → Jane has Intermediate (100% match)
├─ Historical Performance:
│  ├─ Similar Tasks: 7 completed
│  ├─ Average Time: 4.2 days
│  ├─ Quality Score: 9.2/10
│  └─ Current Workload: 2 tasks (manageable)
├─ Availability:
│  └─ 8 hours/day this week
└─ Why Not Bob?
   └─ Bob has only beginner React skills (95% match vs Jane's 100%)
```

**What This Means for You:**
- You know Jane is the best person, backed by data
- You understand why (skills and availability)
- You can see alternatives if Jane is unavailable
- You can prioritize training (if you need to develop Bob's skills)

### Why Explainability Matters for Your Team

### All Explainability Features at a Glance

| Feature | When Used | What You Learn |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Risk Assessment | When evaluating task difficulty | Why it's risky, confidence level, mitigation |
| Deadline Prediction | When planning timeline | How long it'll really take, confidence, scenarios |
| Assignee Recommendation | When assigning work | Who's best match, why, skill gaps |
| Priority Suggestion | When prioritizing tasks | Which tasks matter most, why |
| Workload Forecast | When capacity planning | Who's overloaded, recommendations, conflicts |
| Dependency Analysis | When planning complex projects | Which tasks block others, why, critical path |

### Technical Details (For Non-Tech Users)

**How confident can you be?**

- **95%+ confidence**: Almost certainly accurate - act on it
- **75-95% confidence**: Very reliable - generally trustworthy
- **50-75% confidence**: Moderate - verify before acting
- **<50% confidence**: Uncertain - treat as a suggestion only

**When should you challenge the AI?**

1. You know assumptions are wrong ("Bob doesn't have 6 hours available")
2. Confidence is low (<60%)
3. Data limitations are significant ("We only have 2 similar tasks")
4. You have information the AI doesn't

**How accurate is the AI?**

PrizmAI tracks its own accuracy. Over time you'll see:
- Prediction accuracy improves as more data is available
- Risk assessments become more reliable
- Assignment recommendations consistently identify top performers

## 🪝 Webhook Integration & Event-Driven Architecture

### What Are Webhooks?

Webhooks allow PrizmAI to **automatically notify external apps** when important events happen in your projects. Think of it as "push notifications for your integrations."

**Instead of constantly polling:** "Is there anything new?"
**Webhooks push updates:** "Hey! A task was just assigned!"

### How Webhooks Work

1. **You create a webhook** - Provide a URL where PrizmAI should send notifications
2. **You select events** - Choose which events trigger the webhook (task created, updated, assigned, etc.)
3. **Events happen** - When someone creates/updates a task, PrizmAI sends data to your URL
4. **External app receives data** - Your app processes the JSON payload
5. **External app takes action** - Post to Slack, update a spreadsheet, trigger automation, etc.

### Supported Events

PrizmAI webhooks fire for these events:

**Task Events:**
- ✅ `task.created` - New task added to board
- ✅ `task.updated` - Task details changed (title, description, etc.)
- ✅ `task.completed` - Task moved to done/completed column
- ✅ `task.assigned` - Task assigned to a team member
- ✅ `task.moved` - Task moved to different column
- ✅ `task.deleted` - Task deleted from board

**Comment Events:**
- ✅ `comment.added` - New comment on a task

**Board Events:**
- ✅ `board.updated` - Board settings changed

### Webhook Payload Example

When an event fires, you receive a JSON payload like this:

```json
{
  "event": "task.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "board_id": 42,
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "title": "Design homepage mockup",
    "description": "Create responsive design for homepage",
    "priority": "high",
    "assigned_to": {
      "id": 5,
      "username": "alice",
      "email": "alice@company.com"
    },
    "due_date": "2025-01-20",
    "column": "In Progress"
  }
}
```

### Real-World Integration Examples

#### Example 1: Slack Notifications

```
When: Task assigned to you
PrizmAI sends: Webhook to Slack
Slack shows: 
  "📋 Alice assigned 'Design Homepage' to you (Due: Jan 20)"
  [View Task] [Mark Complete]
```

#### Example 2: Email Alert

```
When: High-priority task created
PrizmAI sends: Webhook to your notification service
You receive: Email with task details and link to view in PrizmAI
```

#### Example 3: Automated Reporting

```
When: Task completed
PrizmAI sends: Webhook to analytics service
Service updates: Weekly progress report automatically
```

### Setting Up a Webhook

**From the Board:**

1. Click the **⚙️ Settings** button
2. Select **"Webhooks & Integrations"**
3. Click **"Add Webhook"**
4. **Fill in:**
   - **Name:** "Slack Notifications" (for reference)
   - **URL:** Your external app's URL (e.g., `https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`)
   - **Events:** Check which events trigger this webhook
   - **Advanced (optional):** Timeout, retry count, custom headers
5. Click **"Create"**
6. Click **"Test"** to verify it works
7. Done! Now events will be sent automatically

- 🔄 Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- 📊 Track delivery success rates
- 🏥 Health monitoring (auto-disable failing webhooks)
- 🔐 HMAC signature verification for security

### Webhook Security

**HMAC Signatures:**

- Each webhook delivery includes an `X-PrizmAI-Signature` header
- Verify this signature to confirm the webhook came from PrizmAI
- Prevents malicious actors from impersonating PrizmAI

```python
# Example: Verify webhook signature (Python)
import hmac
import hashlib

webhook_secret = "your-webhook-secret"
signature = request.headers.get('X-PrizmAI-Signature')
payload_body = request.body

expected_signature = hmac.new(
    webhook_secret.encode(),
    payload_body,
    hashlib.sha256
).hexdigest()

if signature != expected_signature:
    raise ValueError("Invalid signature - not from PrizmAI!")
```
