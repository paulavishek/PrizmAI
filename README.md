Just like chatting with someone in Slack or Teams - natural conversation, smart insights.

### 🎯 Smart Completion Date Predictions

**Know when tasks will actually be done — not just guesses, but data-driven predictions.**

PrizmAI analyzes your team's historical performance and predicts when each task will be completed:

**How It Works:**
1. Open any task on your board
2. See the **"Predicted Completion"** section
3. AI analyzes similar completed tasks from your team
4. Shows predicted completion date with confidence level
5. Click to see which similar tasks were used for the prediction

**What You Get:**
- 📅 **Predicted completion date** - When the task will likely be done
- 📊 **Confidence level** - How reliable the prediction is (50-95%)
- 📈 **Date range** - Optimistic to pessimistic estimates
- 🔍 **Similar tasks** - See the 5-10 historical tasks AI analyzed
- ⚡ **Real-time updates** - Predictions update as work progresses

**Example:**

```
Task: "Implement dashboard feature"
Predicted Completion: Nov 22, 2025
Confidence: 85%
Range: Nov 20 - Nov 25

Based on 7 similar tasks:
✅ "Refactor task module" - 1.5 days (Complexity: 1/10, High priority)
✅ "Implement dashboard" - 3.8 days (Complexity: 3/10, High priority)
✅ "Deploy notifications" - 5.4 days (Complexity: 3/10, High priority)
... and 4 more
```

**What AI Considers:**
- Team member's past performance (velocity)
- Task complexity and priority
- Historical completion times for similar tasks
- Current progress percentage
- Risk factors and dependencies

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ **Realistic planning** - No more guessing deadlines
- ✅ **Identify delays early** - See if tasks will miss due dates
- ✅ **Better resource allocation** - Know who's overloaded
- ✅ **Data-driven decisions** - Base planning on actual team velocity

**Perfect For:**
- Sprint planning (know if you can commit to the deadline)
- Client commitments (give realistic delivery dates)
- Resource planning (understand team capacity)
- Risk management (flag tasks likely to be late)

### 📊 Smart Task Recommendations

When creating a new board:
1. Give it a descriptive name like "Q1 Mobile App Development"
2. Click "Get AI Suggestions"
3. AI recommends the perfect columns for your project type
4. One click to use them

**Result:** Instead of guessing at structure, you get industry-best-practice columns automatically.

### 📝 Auto-Generate Task Details

**Instead of this:**
```
Task: "Build login screen"
(Then you have to think of all the details...)
```

**Get this:**
```
Task: "Build login screen"
✓ Design login UI mockup
✓ Implement email/password fields
✓ Add "remember me" checkbox
✓ Setup password validation
✓ Implement password reset flow
✓ Test on mobile devices
✓ Document for handoff
```

Just click "Generate with AI" and you're done.

### 🎙️ Meeting Transcripts → Tasks

Upload meeting notes or transcripts. AI automatically:
- Identifies action items
- Creates tasks from them
- Suggests priorities
- Assigns to team members

**Result:** No more "Who was supposed to do that?" arguments.

### 💬 Smart Comment Summaries

Long comment threads? Click "Summarize" and get a concise summary of the key points and decisions. Saves hours of reading.

## 🛡️ Advanced Features (When You Need Them)

### Risk Management

The tool helps you think about what could go wrong:

**Example:**
- Task: "Integrate payment system"
- AI analysis: "High risk due to financial sensitivity"
- Suggested mitigation: "Plan thorough testing and backup procedure"
- Risk score: 7/10

Use this for important or complex work.

### Team Capacity Planning

AI predicts your team's workload for the next 2-3 weeks:
- Shows who will be busy
- Flags people who are overloaded
- Suggests how to redistribute work
- Helps prevent burnout

**Result:** Realistic planning instead of optimistic guessing.

### Stakeholder Management

For bigger projects, track who cares about the outcome:
- Who needs to approve decisions
- Who benefits from the project
- Who could block it
- Communication preferences

Keep important people informed and happy.

### Task Dependencies

For complex projects, show how tasks connect:
- "Task A must finish before Task B starts"
- "Task C is waiting on Task D"
- Visual dependency diagrams
- AI suggests dependencies automatically

**Result:** No surprises about blocked work.

### Knowledge Base & Wiki

Create a living document of your project knowledge:
- Create pages in markdown (like Google Docs)
- Link pages to tasks and projects
- Search across all knowledge
- Record meeting notes
- Track decisions and why they were made

**New team members can onboard faster because everything is documented.**

## 🪝 Webhook Integration & Event-Driven Architecture

### What Are Webhooks?

Webhooks allow PrizmAI to **automatically notify external apps** when important events happen in your projects. Think of it as "push notifications for your integrations."

**Instead of constantly polling:** "Is there anything new?"
**Webhooks push updates:** "Hey! A task was just assigned!"

### How Webhooks Work

1. **You create a webhook** - Provide a URL where PrizmAI should send notifications
2. **You select events** - Choose which events trigger the webhook (task created, updated, assigned, etc.)
3. **Events happen** - When someone creates/updates a task, PrizmAI sends data to your URL
4. **External app receives data** - Your app processes the JSON payload
5. **External app takes action** - Post to Slack, update a spreadsheet, trigger automation, etc.

### Supported Events

PrizmAI webhooks fire for these events:

**Task Events:**
- ✅ `task.created` - New task added to board
- ✅ `task.updated` - Task details changed (title, description, etc.)
- ✅ `task.completed` - Task moved to done/completed column
- ✅ `task.assigned` - Task assigned to a team member
- ✅ `task.moved` - Task moved to different column
- ✅ `task.deleted` - Task deleted from board

**Comment Events:**
- ✅ `comment.added` - New comment on a task

**Board Events:**
- ✅ `board.updated` - Board settings changed

### Webhook Payload Example

When an event fires, you receive a JSON payload like this:

```json
{
  "event": "task.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "board_id": 42,
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "title": "Design homepage mockup",
    "description": "Create responsive design for homepage",
    "priority": "high",
    "assigned_to": {
      "id": 5,
      "username": "alice",
      "email": "alice@company.com"
    },
    "due_date": "2025-01-20",
    "column": "In Progress"
  }
}
```

### Real-World Integration Examples

#### Example 1: Slack Notifications

```
When: Task assigned to you
PrizmAI sends: Webhook to Slack
Slack shows: 
  "📋 Alice assigned 'Design Homepage' to you (Due: Jan 20)"
  [View Task] [Mark Complete]
```

#### Example 2: Email Alert

```
When: High-priority task created
PrizmAI sends: Webhook to your notification service
You receive: Email with task details and link to view in PrizmAI
```

#### Example 3: Automated Reporting

```
When: Task completed
PrizmAI sends: Webhook to analytics service
Service updates: Weekly progress report automatically
```

### Setting Up a Webhook

**From the Board:**

1. Click the **⚙️ Settings** button
2. Select **"Webhooks & Integrations"**
3. Click **"Add Webhook"**
4. **Fill in:**
   - **Name:** "Slack Notifications" (for reference)
   - **URL:** Your external app's URL (e.g., `https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`)
   - **Events:** Check which events trigger this webhook
   - **Advanced (optional):** Timeout, retry count, custom headers
5. Click **"Create"**
6. Click **"Test"** to verify it works
7. Done! Now events will be sent automatically

### Webhook Management UI

View and manage all webhooks for your board:

**Webhook List:**

- 📊 See all configured webhooks
- ✅/❌ Active/inactive status
- 📈 Delivery statistics (success rate, failures)
- 🔧 Edit or delete webhooks

**Delivery Logs:**

- 📝 View recent webhook deliveries
- 🕐 Timestamps of each delivery
- 📄 Request/response payloads
- ✅ Success or failure status

**Reliability Features:**

- 🔄 Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- 📊 Track delivery success rates
- 🏥 Health monitoring (auto-disable failing webhooks)
- 🔐 HMAC signature verification for security

### Webhook Security

**HMAC Signatures:**

- Each webhook delivery includes an `X-PrizmAI-Signature` header
- Verify this signature to confirm the webhook came from PrizmAI
- Prevents malicious actors from impersonating PrizmAI

```python
# Example: Verify webhook signature (Python)
import hmac
import hashlib

webhook_secret = "your-webhook-secret"
signature = request.headers.get('X-PrizmAI-Signature')
payload_body = request.body

expected_signature = hmac.new(
    webhook_secret.encode(),
    payload_body,
    hashlib.sha256
).hexdigest()

if signature != expected_signature:
    raise ValueError("Invalid signature - not from PrizmAI!")
```

### Integration Use Cases

**📱 Slack Integration:**

```
Task Created → Webhook → Slack Bot → Post in #projects channel
"New task: 'API Development' assigned to @bob (Due: Friday)"
```

**📊 Google Sheets / Airtable:**

```
Task Updated → Webhook → Zapier → Google Sheets
Spreadsheet automatically updates with latest task status
```

**📧 Email Alerts:**
