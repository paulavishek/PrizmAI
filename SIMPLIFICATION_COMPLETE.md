### 1. `ai_assistant/utils/ai_clients.py`
- ❌ Removed `OpenAIClient` class (120 lines)
- ✅ Kept `GeminiClient` class (50 lines)
- **Result**: Simplified from 170 to 50 lines

### 2. `ai_assistant/utils/chatbot_service.py`

- ❌ Removed `self.openai_client` initialization
- ❌ Removed model selection logic (`if preferred_model == 'openai'`)
- ❌ Removed fallback mechanism
- ✅ Now always uses Gemini
- **Result**: Simplified from 280 to 200 lines

### 3. `ai_assistant/models.py`
- ❌ Removed OpenAI from `AIAssistantMessage.MODEL_CHOICES`
- ❌ Removed `openai_requests` field from `AIAssistantAnalytics`
- ❌ Removed `preferred_model` field from `UserPreference`
- ❌ Removed OpenAI from `UserPreference.preferred_model` choices
- **Result**: Models now simpler, Gemini-only

### 4. `ai_assistant/views.py`
- ❌ Removed `selected_model` variable from `send_message()`
- ❌ Removed `preferred_model` parameter from `chatbot.get_response()` call
- ❌ Removed OpenAI tracking in analytics (`elif response.get('source') == 'openai'`)
- ❌ Removed OpenAI aggregation from `analytics_view()`
- ❌ Removed OpenAI data from chart data in `get_analytics_data()`
- ❌ Removed `preferred_model` handling in preferences

## 🎯 Current Architecture

```
User Question
    ↓
PrizmAIChatbotService
    ├─ Detects: Is this a project query?
    ├─ Detects: Should we search the web?
    ├─ Builds context from PrizmAI data
    ├─ Builds context from Knowledge Base
    └─ Builds context from Web Search (optional)
    ↓
GeminiClient (ONLY MODEL)
    ├─ Sends prompt to Google Gemini 2.5-Flash
    └─ Returns response
    ↓
Response Saved to Database
    ├─ Message content
    ├─ Usage metrics

## 📊 Configuration Simplified

### Before (Multiple API Keys)
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key          # ❌ Not needed anymore
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=optional
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=optional
```

### After (Single API Key)
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key           # ✅ Only this required
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=optional
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=optional
```

## 🚀 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations ai_assistant
python manage.py migrate
```

This updates the database schema to remove OpenAI fields.

### Step 2: Update `.env` (Optional)
If you had:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

You can remove it (it won't be used anymore):
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
# OPENAI_API_KEY=...  # ← Can delete this line
ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=True
```

### Step 3: Test
```bash
python manage.py runserver
# Visit http://localhost:8000/assistant/
# Try chatting - should work normally
```
