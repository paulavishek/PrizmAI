---

## 🚫 Critical Gaps (Must Address)

### 1. **Gantt Charts - MAJOR GAP** ⚠️
**Why it matters:**
- Enterprise PMs depend on Gantt for timeline visualization
- Critical path analysis is essential
- Dependency visualization is fundamental
- Competitors have mature, feature-rich Gantt implementations

**Current state:** ⭐ (Minimal or non-existent)  
**Competitors:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Impact:** Without Gantt charts, PrizmAI loses credibility with traditional PM offices

---

### 2. **Time Tracking / Timesheets** ⚠️
**What's missing:**
- Time entry logging (time tracking exists in codebase but not visible in UI)
- Timesheet management and approval workflows
- Integration with payroll systems
- Time estimation vs actuals analysis

**Why it matters:**
- Critical for labor cost tracking
- Required for resource utilization calculations
- Necessary for productivity metrics
- All competitors have this fully implemented

---

### 3. **Portfolio Management** ⚠️
**What's missing:**
- Program-level views across multiple projects
- Cross-project resource allocation
- Portfolio-level reporting and dashboards
- Strategic alignment tracking

**Competitors have:** Mature portfolio management  
**PrizmAI:** Single-board focus

---

### 4. **Advanced Reporting & Analytics** ⚠️
**Current strengths:**
- ✅ Burndown charts
- ✅ Budget analytics
- ✅ Velocity tracking
- ✅ User feedback analytics

**Gaps:**
- No custom report builder
- Limited export options (CSV, PDF, Excel)
- No scheduled report delivery
- No advanced BI integration
- Limited historical trend analysis

---

### 5. **Enterprise & Governance** ⚠️
**What's missing:**
- User roles & permissions (basic only)
- Approval workflows
- Change management workflows
- Compliance & audit logging
- SSO/SAML integration
- Data governance features

**Why it matters:** Enterprise customers won't adopt without these

---

### 6. **Mobile Experience** ⚠️
**Current state:** PWA support (limited)  
**Competitors:** Full native apps for iOS/Android

---

### 7. **Integration Ecosystem** ⚠️
**Current:** Webhook support, REST API, Slack/Teams ready  
**Competitors:** 
- 1000+ pre-built integrations
- Native connectors to accounting, CRM, HR systems
- Zapier/Make.com integration
- Custom integration builder

---

## 🎯 PrizmAI's Path to Competitive Victory

### **Positioning Strategy: "The Intelligent PM Tool"**

Instead of competing head-to-head with feature parity, position PrizmAI as:
- **"For teams who want their PM tool to help them make better decisions"**
- **"The transparent, explainable AI for project management"**
- **"AI-assisted PM - where you stay in control"**

This works because:
1. ✅ It's genuinely different from competitors
2. ✅ It fills a real market need (explainable AI)
3. ✅ It justifies feature gaps (focus on quality over quantity)
4. ✅ It appeals to risk-averse enterprises

- **Target:** Enterprises that want AI they can trust
- **Differentiate on:** Explainability, not feature count
- **Close gaps:** Gantt charts and enterprise governance (non-negotiable)
- **Timing:** 6 months to become credible enterprise contender

The explainable AI differentiator is **genuinely valuable** and hard for competitors to replicate. Use it to build trust, then fill the gaps to become a complete PM solution.
