## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR TESTING

### Tip 1: Start Simple
```
Test basic questions first (Beginner level)
Then move to intermediate
Finally try advanced
This builds understanding of capabilities
```

### Tip 2: Compare Against Real Data
```
Before asking AI "How many boards?"
Know the actual answer (e.g., 5)
Then compare AI's answer to reality
This makes accuracy clear
```

### Tip 3: Ask Follow-ups
```
If AI's answer is vague, ask why
Ask "How did you get that number?"
This reveals what data it used
And tests depth of understanding
```

### Tip 4: Document Patterns
```
Don't wait until end to analyze
Note patterns as you test
"Tasks always work but risks fail"
"Web search not triggering for..."
Makes debugging easier
```

### Tip 5: Test in Context
```
Don't ask random questions
Test with scenario: "For Q4 board..."
Ask multiple related questions
See if AI maintains context
This reveals more realistic behavior
```
